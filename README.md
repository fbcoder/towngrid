# About
City builder in Python. Far from finished but the very basics are there: tiles, road construction, houses, passing of time and a very simpel economy model. 

# How to run (general)
1. Install [Python](http://www.python.org/) for your OS
2. Install [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/) for your OS
3. Execute/read towngrid.py with Python.

## Linux specific
Likely Python is already installed on your distribution of choice. You might have to install PyGame. On Ubuntu this can be done like so: apt-get install python-pygame
